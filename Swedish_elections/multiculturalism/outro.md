**Method and data**

Data can be found [here](https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101Q/) and [here](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/10/10/401/htm). Note that Oceania represents less than 0.1% of the population and hence is not shown in the graphs.

Visualisation made with Flourish and Scrollama.
