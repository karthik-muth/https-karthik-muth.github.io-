            After the war, Sweden opened its borders primarily for labour
            immigration.

            In the 1950s and 1960s, migrant workers moved from Finland and
            other European countries. By the end of 1970, the share of the
            foreign-born population was nearly 7%, and almost all of them
            were from Europe.

            In 1975, the Swedish parliament voted for multiculturalism. The
            following years saw a transition from a labour-based to a
            refugee-based immigration. People primarily came from the Middle
            East, South America and Yugoslavia.

            Sweden joined the European Union In 1995 and the Schengen area
            in 2001. Following this, Sweden received more immigrants from
            Europe. By the end of 2010, nearly 15% of the population were
            foreign-born of which 6% were from outside Europe.

            The 2010s saw more than 100k immigrants moving to Sweden each
            year reaching the peak of 163k in 2016 during the Syrian civil
            war. By the end of 2021, nearly 20% of the population was born

            Today, the population of Sweden is nearly 10.5 million of which
            around 2.1 million (20%) are foreign-born. They represent more

            countries in the world.

      <p class="text-h3">Attitudes towards immigration and ethnic diversity </p>
      <br /><br />

      <p class="text-body-2">
        "Sweden has had a generous migration policy for a relatively long time" and has experienced a steady increase in
        the share of population with foreign backgrounds. While the integration issues remain, "the anti-immigration
        political parties, have focused on the shortcomings of Swedish immigration policies".

        The Diversity Barometer survey (2005 to 2020) from the study on attitudes towards immigration showed "a positive
        trend in Swedes’ attitudes up to 2014. The subsequent years showed an increased negativity explained by the
        refugee crisis in 2015 when Sweden received many refugees. Negative public and political discourse about
        refugees, and restrictive immigration policies in Sweden are also attributed to the refugee crisis".

        However, the study also showed that "the attitude has become more positive in the recent years. This is
        especially seen among the people "that have the experience of working/studying and socialize frequently with
        people of foreign background".</p>

      <p class="blockquote">"Positive attitudes were more established among women, younger people, those with higher
        education, people living in larger cities and those with more contact with people with foreign background." </p>
      <br /><br />

      <p class="text-body-2">

        The study further showed that
        <i>"a negative assessment of the cultural consequences of immigration is a reason for the deteriorating
          attitudes
          towards immigration. The negative attitudes of the working class and their decision to vote for right-wing
          populist parties are mainly due to considering the nation’s culture at threat from immigration.

          "Today, Sweden is facing augmentation of anti-immigration political parties and groups. Extreme attitudes
          towards ethnic diversity risk increasing polarization (...) which in turn may complicate integration and
          cohesion."</i>
        <br /><br />
        These positive and negative attitudes will play a vital role in the upcoming elections.
