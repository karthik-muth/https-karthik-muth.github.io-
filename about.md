#### Hello üëã,

I'm **Karthik Muthuswamy**, a freelance visual journalist and software developer based in Stockholm. I enjoy creating visual stories using
interactive storytelling techniques.

When I‚Äôm not working, I enjoy being in nature, hiking in the mountains or by the sea doing activities like üßó ‚õ∑ ‚õ∫Ô∏è üõ∂ üèä.
<br><br><br>

#### I'm creating a media platform
I'm creating a platform with a focus on creating equitable, inclusive and visual journalism in Sweden. Are you interested in the idea and want to know more? Are you a content creator/journalist who wants to publish on a platform like [Substack](substack.com)? Get in touch.
<br><br><br>

#### I'm looking for freelance opportunities
Do you want to turn your data/information/report into a visual story? Are you a content creator that is looking for a collaborator? My skills include:

**Software and technology:** I have more than a decade's work experience in several platforms and programming languages. [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/papanash/).

**Data journalism:** This website is my portfolio as a data journalist and it's under development. You can find the stories I created as part of the major project for my Master‚Äôs in data journalism [here]({{ site.url }}/elections).
<br><br><br>


#### Techniques and tools used in this website
This website was created with a lot of care. It was possible because of the support of the following open-source and/or free applications:
- Data: Python, Pandas, Plotly, etc
- Visualisation tools: Flourish, Datawrapper, Plotly, RawGraphs, Scrollama
- Web development: Javascript, Bootstrap, Jekyll, Colin Eberhardt's Applause button

I have explained why I create stories in the way I do [here](https://karthik-m.medium.com/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words-whats-a-data-viz-worth-6ea3b0d5c66?source=friends_link&sk=60a827d05b1b5a41d5ae43c5c1911553), and about the interactive techniques I have used [here]({{ site.url }}/elections/#collapseOne).
