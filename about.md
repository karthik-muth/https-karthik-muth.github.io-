I'm **Karthik Muthuswamy**, a freelance visual journalist and software developer based in Stockholm. I enjoy creating visual stories using
interactive storytelling techniques. All the stories and analyses on this website are created by me unless stated otherwise.

I'm an outdoor person. When I‚Äôm not working, I enjoy being in nature, hiking in the mountains or by the sea doing activities like üßó ‚õ∑ ‚õ∫Ô∏è üõ∂ üèä.

I'm creating a platform with a focus on creating equitable, inclusive and visual journalism in Sweden. Are you interested in the idea and want to know more? Are you a content creator/journalist who wants to publish on a platform like [Substack](substack.com)? Get in touch.

#### Techniques and tools used in this website
This website was created with a lot of care. It was possible because of the support of the following open-source and/or free applications:
- Data: Python, Pandas, Plotly, etc
- Visualisation tools: Flourish, Datawrapper, Plotly, RawGraphs, Scrollama
- Web development: Javascript, Bootstrap, Jekyll, Colin Eberhardt's Applause button

I have explained why I create stories in the way I do [here](https://karthik-m.medium.com/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words-whats-a-data-viz-worth-6ea3b0d5c66?source=friends_link&sk=60a827d05b1b5a41d5ae43c5c1911553), and about the interactive techniques I have used [here]({{ site.url }}/elections/#collapseOne).
