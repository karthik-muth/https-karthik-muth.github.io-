Sweden is one of the most multicultural countries in Europe today, with more than a quarter of its population being of foreign background.

This can be traced back to a [decision made in 1975](https://lagen.nu/prop/1975:26) by the Swedish parliament - led by the Social Democrats and the prime minister at the time, Olof Palme - to make the country a multicultural society.

[Mahama Tawat, Associate professor at Jönköping University](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VQos0d8AAAAJ&hl=en), said:
_"Multiculturalism is used in reference to ethnic pluralism in terms of race, ethnicity and religion. The policy aims to give recognition and promote immigrants' culture (practices and beliefs) by giving them official group rights, institutionalised in policies and the constitution. In addition, it also aims to give financial support to their ethnic associations, newspapers, festivals, mother language teaching, etc."_

Thus Sweden, along with Canada and Australia, became one of the first countries in the West to adopt this idea formally. Since then, immigration to Sweden has been steadily increasing.

In the recent years, "the political and media discourse has focused on the shortcomings of Swedish immigration policies. This discourse has negatively affected the public opinion and Sweden has experienced a steady increase in sympathy for anti-immigration policies", according to a [study on attitudes towards immigration and ethnic diversity](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0760/10/10/401/htm).

<br />**A brief look before the 1970s**<br />
Before the second world war, the social democrat concept of Folkhemmet (the people’s homes) aimed to modernize society while diminishing the impact of social class. Assimilation, as opposed to integration, was the political stance regarding immigrants. Sweden was largely culturally and linguistically homogeneous at this time except for the Sami and Tornedalian minorities.
