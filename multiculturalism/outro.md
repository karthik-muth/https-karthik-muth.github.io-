<p class="text-h3">Attitudes towards immigration and ethnic diversity </p>

<p class="text-body-2">

"Sweden has had a generous migration policy for a relatively long time" and has experienced a steady increase in the share of population with foreign backgrounds. While the integration issues remain, "the anti-immigration political parties, have focused on the shortcomings of Swedish immigration policies".

The Diversity Barometer survey (2005 to 2020) from the study on attitudes towards immigration showed "a positive trend in Swedes’ attitudes up to 2014. The subsequent years showed an increased negativity explained by the refugee crisis in 2015 when Sweden received many refugees. Negative public and political discourse about refugees, and restrictive immigration policies in Sweden are also attributed to the refugee crisis".

However, the study also showed that "the attitude has become more positive in the recent years. This is especially seen among the people "that have the experience of working/studying and socialize frequently with people of foreign background".</p>

<p class="blockquote">"Positive attitudes were more established among women, younger people, those with higher education, people living in larger cities and those with more contact with people with foreign background." </p>

The study further showed that
_"a negative assessment of the cultural consequences of immigration is a reason for the deteriorating attitudes towards immigration. The negative attitudes of the working class and their decision to vote for right-wing populist parties are mainly due to considering the nation’s culture at threat from immigration._

_"Today, Sweden is facing augmentation of anti-immigration political parties and groups. Extreme attitudes towards ethnic diversity risk increasing polarization (...) which in turn may complicate integration and cohesion."_

These positive and negative attitudes will play a vital role in the upcoming elections.
