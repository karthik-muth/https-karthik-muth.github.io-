steps:
- 'Women earned more than men in all age groups, except 91+, during the one year period to February 2022. On average,
women made a 10% median Return on Investment while men made 4%.'
- 'Women in the age-group 18-30 earned six times more than men.'
- "While women are better at investing, only 38% of Avanza's investors are women – and they own just around a quarter of
the total capital in Avanza."
- 'On average, men have more capital than women already when they are 18. They reach 100k when they are 23 years, while
women reach that at 28, according to newer data from September 2022.'
- 'The capital for men and women increases with age — and so does the gap between them.'
- "An average man in his 70's has more than a million sek. They own two to three times more than women in the
respective age."
