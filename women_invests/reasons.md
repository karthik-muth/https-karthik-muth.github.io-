### Three reasons why women are better in investing

<br>

Moa Langemark, an Analyst at Avanza [said](https://investors.avanza.se/media/press/2022/kvinnor-investerar-dubbelt-sa-bra-som-man):
- Women invest more in bonds and men in more stocks. People with more bonds earn more.
- Women have a more passive strategy and make less risky investments. They have historically avoided panic-selling during stock market crash events.
- Women tend to invest in companies they know well and whose products and services they use themselves.

Moa adds that women, on average, save less than men every month which is one of the factors as to why women have less capital.
