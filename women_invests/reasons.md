### Three reasons why women are better at investing

<br>

Moa Langemark, an Analyst at Avanza [said](https://investors.avanza.se/media/press/2022/kvinnor-investerar-dubbelt-sa-bra-som-man):
- Women invest more in interest-bearing bond funds and men more in stocks. People who invest more in funds earn more.
- Women have a more passive strategy and make less risky investments. They have historically avoided panic-selling during stock market crash events.
- Women tend to invest in companies they know well and whose products and services they use themselves.

Moa adds that women, on average, save less than men every month which is one of the factors as to why women have less capital.

Average monthly savings as of Feb 2022 for women: 2100 SEK and men: 2700 SEK.
