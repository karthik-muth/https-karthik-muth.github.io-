**Three reasons as to why women are better, according to Moa Langemark, an Analyst at Avanza:**
- Women invest more in bonds and men in more stocks. People with more bonds earn more.
- Women have a more passive strategy and make less risky investments. They have historically avoided panic-selling during stock market crash events.
- Women tend to invest in companies they know well and whose products and services they use themselves.
