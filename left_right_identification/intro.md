The political identification of men has increased significantly towards the right since 1968, according to a [study](https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2021-02/2021%201%20Oskarson%20%26%20Ahlbom%20-%20Trender%20i%20ko%CC%88nsskillnader.pdf) by the [Election Research Program (Valforskningsprogrammet)](https://www.gu.se/valforskningsprogrammet) of the University of Gothenburg.

Since the 1970s, voter turnout has been about the same for both genders. However, there are gaps in political preferences and identification, which have widened over the past decade.

Jakob Ahlbom - who reported the study along with Maria Oskarson - said: _"the last couple of decades have seen a rightwards shift among men – in relation to women. The first wave (approx. 1982-1998) is related to the neoliberal wave and a revolt against the social democratic past which for various reasons hit harder among men. The latter wave (since 2006 and in particular since 2018) is more related to the “cultural backlash”._

A survey question in the study asked the participants to place themselves on a scale of left to right by political position. The average of answers for men and women showed that men identify considerably more to the right, and women slightly to the left. The gap between men and women has been widening since 2010 and reached its peak before the 2018 elections.
