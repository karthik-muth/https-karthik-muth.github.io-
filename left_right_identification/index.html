        <b>The widening gap in the last decade can be attributed to the
          differences in how men and women vote for different parties.</b>
        <br /><br />
        This can be seen from the Party sympathy survey(PSU) taken -every
        half year- by Statistics Sweden. The data shows that the party
        â€“Sweden Democrats- that entered the parliament in 2010 has the
        biggest difference between male and female sympathizers.

            The percentage of men that would vote for Sweden Democrats has
            increased by more than three times since 2010. The percentage
            point difference between men and women in the survey taken in
            May 2022 is 13.7%.

            The Social Democrats has the next biggest difference. While
            the party received nearly the same percentage of sympathizers
            before 2010 from both genders, the difference is more than ten
            percent, this year.

            Historically, the Moderate party had a higher proportion of
            male sympathizers. But in the latest survey, the party, along
            with Christian Democrats, Liberals and Center Party, have an
            approximately equal proportion of male and female
            sympathizers.

            The latest survey shows that both the left and right blocks
            would get a clear majority from women and men respectively.

        The study showed that, in comparison to men, women "place higher priorities on welfare issues, and are more
        positive about public welfare policies". This is reflected in their support for the political parties, and in
        the previous election in 2018 "women voted distinctively more to the left than men did".
