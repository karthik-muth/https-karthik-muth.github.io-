steps:
- 'The percentage of men that would vote for **Sweden Democrats** has increased by more than three times since 2010. The
percentage point difference between men and women in the survey taken in May 2022 is 13.7%.'
- 'The **Social Democrats** has the next biggest difference. While the party received nearly the same percentage of
sympathizers before 2010 from both genders, the difference is more than ten percent, this year.'
- 'A similar trend can be seen for the **Left Party** since 2010.'
- 'The **Green Party** has always had a higher degree of female sympathizers, and it remains the same.'
- 'Historically, the **Moderate party** had a higher proportion of male sympathizers. But in the latest survey, the
party, along with **Christian Democrats, Liberals and Center Party**, have an approximately equal proportion of male and
female sympathizers.'
- 'The latest survey shows that both the left and right blocks would get a clear majority from women and men
respectively.'

    <b>The widening gap in the last decade can be attributed to the
      differences in how men and women vote for different parties.</b>
    <br /><br />
    This can be seen from the Party sympathy survey(PSU) taken -every
    half year- by Statistics Sweden. The data shows that the party
    â€“Sweden Democrats- that entered the parliament in 2010 has the
    biggest difference between male and female sympathizers.

    The study showed that, in comparison to men, women "place higher priorities on welfare issues, and are more
    positive about public welfare policies". This is reflected in their support for the political parties, and in
    the previous election in 2018 "women voted distinctively more to the left than men did".
