In a series of analyses, I have reported on political issues such as immigration, gender inequality, polarisation, representation in local government, etc ahead of the elections on September 11th. 

My resources include reports from the research institutions, discussions with experts and data from various governmental institutions and research publications. I created most of the following articles using [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964) and other interactive techniques. You can explore the data using the charts found often at the end of the article.
