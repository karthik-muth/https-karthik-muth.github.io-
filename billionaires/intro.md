The top eight US [big-tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Tech) billionaires have together lost a quarter of their net worth (316 billion US dollars) since the stock markets peaked in November 2021, according to the latest [report from Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/forbes-400/). This loss, however, pales in comparison with their 140% (729 billion US dollars) gain from the start of the pandemic until the peak.

The combined net worth of the eight billionaires is 932 billion US dollars which is nearly twice as much as they owned before the pandemic, according to data from the Forbes list as of September 2, 2022.
