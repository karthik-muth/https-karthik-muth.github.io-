<p class="text-h2"> Crime is the most important issue - but it depends on who you ask</p>

<p class="text-body-2"><br />

More than 40% of the Swedish voters said crime is the most important issue, according to the [latest survey](https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2022-03/L%C3%A5ngsiktiga%20trender%20och%20viktiga%20samh%C3%A4llsproblem%20-%20Johan%20Martinsson_0.pdf) by SOM Institute at Gothenburg University.
However, younger people (in age group 16-29) -and all left-leaning respondents- said environment is the most important issue. People in the age group 30-49 chose integration.

A survey question in the study asked the participants to provide a maximum of three issues/societal problems that they think are the most important in Sweden today.
