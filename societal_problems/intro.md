More than 40% of the people said crime is the most important issue, according to the [latest survey](https://www.gu.se/sites/default/files/2022-03/L%C3%A5ngsiktiga%20trender%20och%20viktiga%20samh%C3%A4llsproblem%20-%20Johan%20Martinsson_0.pdf) by SOM Institute at Gothenburg University.
However, younger people (in age group 16-29) -and all left-leaning respondents- said environment is the most important issue. People in the age group 30-49 said chose integration.

Henrik Ekengren Oscarsson and Johan Martinsson wrote in a [report](https://mediestudier.se/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vim-03-henriksson_oscarsson.pdf) that "this is the first time crime has come top since the surveys began in 1979".

A survey question in the study asked the participants to provide a maximum of three issues/societal problems that they think are the most important in Sweden today.
