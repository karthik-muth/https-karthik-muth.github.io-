In a series of analyses, I have reported on political issues such as immigration, gender inequality, polarisation, representation in local government, etc ahead of the elections on September 11th.

I created a visual history to take the readers back to the time:
* when [multiculturalism law was adopted](/multiculturalism)
* when [men were more left-wing than women](/left_right_identification)
* and when [environment was the most important issue](/societal_problems).

I visualised the different perspectives on the top political issues â€“ that did not get proportional attention in mainstream media. I analyzed the major Swedish media to [explore the attention differernt politicians](/trends) get.

I highlighted [the gender inequality in the lesser-known local government](/municipal_councils) in one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.
