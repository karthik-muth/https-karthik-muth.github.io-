title:  Lack of immigrant perspective – and other lessons learnt from reporting on Swedish elections
---

**_Here are my reflections from reporting on Swedish elections that would fundamentally shift Sweden's integration policies – from an immigrant perspective._**
<br><br>

#### Why did I choose to report on the elections?

Sweden was about to elect its new government.

Sweden was also on its way to electing a populist party into the government for the first time in history. Polls showed that a fifth of the Swedish population would vote for [Sweden Democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats), a right-wing populist political party.

Considering the following facts, this would be a fundamental political change for Sweden. Sweden is one of:
* The few countries in the West that have formally **adopted a law** in favour of integration instead of assimilation.
* The few European countries that have **not yet**(as of September 11th) elected a **populist party** into their government.
* Most **diverse** countries in the west.
* The top five countries in the [democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
<br><br>

#### What did I report?

Integration was one of the most discussed political issues. The political discourse and debates from the majority of the big parties arguably focused on the failed integration policies. Crime, another political issue, was grouped with the issue of integration.

From an immigrant perspective(because I‘m one), I reported on crime, integration, polarisation and gender inequality in a series of analyses.

I created a visual history to take the readers back to the time:
* when [multiculturalism law was adopted]({{ site.url }}/multiculturalism)
* when [men were more left-wing than women]({{ site.url }}/left_right_identification)
* when [environment was the most important issue]({{ site.url }}/societal_problems).

I visualised the different perspectives today –including the political issues according to different people groups– that did not get proportional attention in mainstream media.

I highlighted [the gender inequality in the lesser-known local government]({{ site.url }}/municipal_councils) in one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.

#### What's next?

The election results are here, and Sweden might have made **the fundamental political shift**.

During this project, I learned a lot. Most notably, I understood the **lack of immigrant perspective** in Swedish media. There is a lack of representation of journalists who report on the issues faced by the immigrants in Sweden – a quarter of the Swedish population. There is a lack of diversity(almost absent) in news content for the non-Swedish-speaking community. The media in Sweden –which enjoys the [best freedom of the press](https://rsf.org/en/index)– has ignored a portion of its population.

This leads me to one of my next projects: to understand the role of Swedish media in informing/not-informing news to immigrants.
