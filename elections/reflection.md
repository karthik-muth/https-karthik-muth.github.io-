title: Reflections on why I reported on Swedish elections – and lessons learned
---

***Here are my reflections on why I chose to report on the elections that would fundamentally shift Sweden's integration policies – and what I learned from it.***
<br><br>

Sweden was about to elect its new government.

Sweden was also on its way to electing a populist party into the government for the first time in history. Polls showed that a fifth of the Swedish population would vote for [Sweden democrats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sweden_Democrats), a right-wing populist political party.

This would be a **fundamental political change** for Sweden considering the following facts. Sweden is one of:
- most diverse countries in the west.
- the few countries in the West that have formally adopted a law in favor of integration instead of assimilation.
- the few countries in Europe that have not yet elected a populist party into its government.
- the top five countries in the [democracy index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy_Index).
- the top three in the [freedom of press index](https://rsf.org/en/index).

##### What's my connection?
I'm an **immigrant** and I'm passionate about **journalism**. I happen to do the major project for my Master's in Data journalism this summer. It made all the sense to understand the big changes that Sweden is going through and report on it.

**Integration** was one of the main and most discussed **political issues**. The political discourse and debates from the majority of the big parties arguably focused on the failed integration policies. Crime, another political issue, was grouped with the issue of integration.

From an immigrant perspective(not by choice), I reported on crime, integration, polarisation and gender inequality in a **series of analyses**.

I created a visual history to take the readers back to the time when [multiculturalism law was adopted]({{ site.url }}/multiculturalism), when [men were more left-wing than women]({{ site.url }}/left_right_identification), and when [environment was the most important issue]({{ site.url }}/societal_problems). I visualised the different perspectives today –including the political issues according to different people groups– that did not get proportional attention in mainstream media. I highlighted [the gender inequality in the lesser-known local government]({{ site.url }}/municipal_councils) in one of the most gender-equal countries in the world.

##### What's next?
The election results are here and Sweden might have made **the** fundamental shift.

During this two months project, I learned a lot. Most notably, I understood the **lack of immigrant perspective in Swedish media**. There is a lack of representation of journalists who report on the issues faced by the immigrants in Sweden – a quarter of the Swedish population. There is a lack of diversity(almost absent) in news content for the non-Swedish-speaking community. The media in Sweden –which enjoys being among the best in the world in press freedom– has ignored a portion of its population.

This leads me to one of my next projects: to understand the role of Swedish media in **informing/not-informing** news to immigrants.
