### Sources
My resources include reports from the research institutions, discussions with experts and data from various governmental institutions and research publications.

### Interaction techniques used
I created most of the following articles using [scrollytelling](https://medium.com/nightingale/from-storytelling-to-scrollytelling-a-short-introduction-and-beyond-fbda32066964) and other interactive techniques. You can explore the data using the charts found often at the end of the article.
