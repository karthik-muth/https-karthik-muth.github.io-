Hello 👋, 
I'm Karthik Muthuswamy, a freelance visual journalist and a software developer based in Stockholm. I enjoy creating visual stories using
interactive storytelling techniques.

When I’m not working, I enjoy being in nature, hiking in the mountains or by the sea doing activities like 🧗 ⛷ ⛺️ 🛶 🏊.

Do you want to give feedback or want or just want to discuss something? Did you find something interesting while exploring the graphs? It is potentially a new story! 

Your feedback/feedforward is highly valuable to me! Don't hesitate to contact me on Twitter [@karthik\_muth](https://twitter.com/karthik_muth) or email at feedforward.tome@gmail.com.
