#### Hello 👋,

I'm **Karthik Muthuswamy**, a freelance visual journalist and a software developer based in Stockholm. I enjoy creating visual stories using
interactive storytelling techniques.

When I’m not working, I enjoy being in nature, hiking in the mountains or by the sea doing activities like 🧗 ⛷ ⛺️ 🛶 🏊.

#### I'm looking for a job
I'm looking for a job as a data journalist/storyteller or as a developer. I have more than a decade's work experience. Here is my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/papanash/).
<br><br><br>

#### Techniques and tools used in this website
This website is created with the support of the following open-source and/or free applications:
- Data: Python, Pandas, Plotly, etc
- Visualisation tools: Flourish, Datawrapper, Plotly, RawGraphs, Scrollama
- Web development: Javascript, Bootstrap, Jekyll, Colin Eberhardt's Applause button

I have explained why I create stories in the way I do [here]("https://karthik-m.medium.com/a-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-words-whats-a-data-viz-worth-6ea3b0d5c66?source=friends_link&sk=60a827d05b1b5a41d5ae43c5c1911553), and about the interactive techniques I have used [here]({{ site.url }}/elections/#interaction).

#### Do you want to publish your articles like this?
I'm planning to create a platform like [Medium](https://medium.com/) for publishing **visual** articles with customizable code. Are you a content creator who wants to publish your articles on a free platform? Get in touch. Note that Medium is not entirely free for readers and as a publisher, you can't customize your articles with code.

Do you want to give feedback or want or just want to discuss something? Did you find something interesting while exploring the graphs? It is potentially a new story! Your thoughts/suggestions are highly valuable to me.
